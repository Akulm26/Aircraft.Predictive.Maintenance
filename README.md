# Aircraft.Predictive.Maintenance

This predictive maintenance project focuses on the techniques used to predict the time an in-service machine will fail, for planning maintenance in advance. In particular, this project illustrates the process of predicting future failure events in the scenario of aircraft turbofan engine failures.

Engine degradation simulation was carried out using C-MAPSS. Four different were sets simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. Records several sensor channels to characterize fault evolution. The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.
